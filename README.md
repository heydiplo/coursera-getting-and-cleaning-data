This is a course project for Coursera ['Getting and Cleaning Data'](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata) course.

The only executable script is `run_analysis.R`, which assumes you already have data in the current directory and writes to the standard output. You can use it like that:

```bash
Rscript run_analysis.R > output.txt
```
